An explicit representation of solutions to
@eq:linear_damped_wave //[ref type:eqref]
is derived through the substitution
$u(t,x)=e^(-t/2)w(t,x)$
,
which transforms
@eq:linear_damped_wave //[ref type:eqref]
into the wave-type equation
	$
∂_t^(2) w - Δ w = (1)/(4) w,
	$ //[formula type:align]
which highlights the wave structure; for details, see Chapter VI, Section 6 in
@CH89 //[ref type:cite]
.
In particular,
@eq:transformed_wave_equation //[ref type:eqref]
yields the following
comparison principle for
@eq:DW //[ref type:eqref]
in one and two dimensional case:
if
$\overline{u_(0)} ≥ \underline{u_(0)} $
and
$\overline{u_(1)} + \overline{u_(0)}/2 ≥ \underline{u_(1)} + \underline{u_(0)}/2$
,
then the solutions

of
@eq:DW //[ref type:eqref]

$\overline{u_(0)}, \overline{u_(1)}$
and
$\underline{u}$
with
$\underline{u_(0)}, \underline{u_(1)}$
satisfy
$\overline{u}(t,x) ≥ \underline{u}(t,x)$
for all
$t ≥ 0$
and
$x$
.
This comparison principle will be a key tool in what follows.
Hereafter, we denote by
$S(t)f$
the solution to
@eq:linear_damped_wave //[ref type:eqref]
corresponding to the data
$(u_(0),u_(1))=(0,f)$

Marcati and Nishihara

in the one- and three-dimensional cases, respectively.
Namely, for a sufficiently regular function

We refer to
@IIOW19 //[ref type:cite]

We note that, even before the explicit proofs by Marcati and Nishihara,
this idea had been used in the perturbative analysis of solutions to

Returning to the Cauchy problem
@eq:DW //[ref type:eqref]
,
the local existence of solutions to
@eq:DW //[ref type:eqref]
is known under standard regularity assumptions.
For example, a classical result can be found in
@s90 //[ref type:cite]
.
Moreover, the discussion in
@MN03 //[ref type:cite]
implies that
$S(t)$
satisfies the same
$L^(p)$
–
$L^(q)$
type estimates
as
$e^(t Δ)$
.
Therefore, the following local existence result holds:
#lemma(title: "Local existence", id: "lemma:local_existence")[
Assume that
$(u_0,u_1) ∈ W^{1,∞} ∩ W^{1,1} × L^∞ ∩ L^1$ and $p > 1$ and $n =1$.
There exists
$T_1=T_1(u_0,u_1)$
such that @eq:DW //[ref type:eqref] possesses a unique mild solution
$u ∈ C( //[command type:left]
	[ //[command type:left]
	0, T_1) //[command type:right]
 ;W^{1,∞} ∩ W^{1,1}) //[command type:right]

	$ sup_{0 ≤ t ≤ T_1} \|u(t) \|_{ L^{∞}}
	≲ ( \|u_0 \|_{L^∞} + \|u_1 \|_{L^∞}). $ //[formula type:align]

Here
$W^(1,q)$
for
$1 ≤ q ≤ ∞$
denotes the usual Sobolev space,
a collection of measurable functions
$f$
such that both
$f$
and its weak derivative
$f^'$
belong to
$L^(q)$
.
We also note that
$p=1+2/n$
is the so-called Fujita critical exponent,
which gives the threshold for blow-up of positive solutions to
@eq:DW //[ref type:eqref]
and for the existence of global solutions to the Fujita-type heat equation:
	$
∂_t v - Δ v = |v|^p.
	$ //[formula type:align]

We also remark that when
$n ∈ ℕ$
,
$p > 1+2/n$
,
and the initial data are sufficiently small,
then solutions to
@eq:DW //[ref type:eqref]
exist globally in time.

Although the solution to
@eq:linear_damped_wave //[ref type:eqref]
can be constructed explicitly from
@eq:transformed_wave_equation //[ref type:eqref]
,
the asymptotic equivalence
@eq:asymptotic_equivalence //[ref type:eqref]
is a powerful tool for analyzing solutions to
@eq:DW //[ref type:eqref]
.
Roughly speaking, one may analyze solutions
$u$
to
@eq:DW //[ref type:eqref]
by treating
$u$
as if it were
$e^(t Δ)(u_(0) + u_(1))$
—that is,
as if
$u$
behaved like the heat flow generated by the initial mass
$u_(0)+u_(1)$
.
For example, Li and Zhou
@LZ95 //[ref type:cite]
showed that
when
$n = 1, 2$
and
$1 < p ≤ 3$
,
if
	$
∫ u_(0) + u_(1) dx > 0,
	$ //[formula type:align]
then, irrespective of the size of the initial data,
the solution
$u$
to
@eq:DW //[ref type:eqref]
blows up in finite time.
Moreover, they derived sharp estimates for the lifespan in terms of the size of the initial data.
In
@LZ95 //[ref type:cite]
, the authors rigorously estimated the infimum of the solution
$u$
in a parabolic region,
as if, roughly speaking,
$u$
behaved like
$e^(t Δ) (u_(0) + u_(1))$
,
and introduced an ODE governing the infimum of
$u$
.
Later,
Zhang
@Z01 //[ref type:cite]
,
Ikeda and Wakasugi
@IW15 //[ref type:cite]
,
and Ikeda and Sobajima
@IS19 //[ref type:cite]
proved finite-time blow-up of
the spatial mean of solutions to
@eq:DW //[ref type:eqref]
and derived lifespan estimates
in more general spatial settings,
still under the initial condition
@eq:initial_mean_condition //[ref type:eqref]
.
Their approach is based on the weak formulation of
@eq:DW //[ref type:eqref]
and is more closely tied to the scaling properties of
@eq:DW //[ref type:eqref]
than to the asymptotic equivalence
@eq:asymptotic_equivalence //[ref type:eqref]
.
Recently, the present authors
@FG25a //[ref type:cite]
showed the finite-time blow-up of solutions to
@eq:DW //[ref type:eqref]
and obtained sharp lifespan estimates
under the mean-zero initial condition
	$
	∫ u_(0) + u_(1) dx = 0,
	u_(0), u_(1) ¬≡ 0.
	$ //[formula type:align]
The approach of
@FG25a //[ref type:cite]
is inspired by that of Li and Zhou
@LZ95 //[ref type:cite]
.
We note that
the mean-zero condition
@eq:initial_mean_condition_ours //[ref type:eqref]
cannot be handled by a direct application of a weak formulation approach.

// %[[[ The arguments above do not yield
The arguments above do not yield
the sharp initial conditions for blow-up.
In particular, for any
$μ_0, μ_1 ∈ ℝ$
,
by combining the finite propagation speed
with the arguments above,
for any
$μ_0, μ_1 ∈ ℝ$
,
there exist smooth initial data
$(u_(0), u_(1))$
satisfying
	$
	
	∫ u_(0) dx = μ_0,
	
	∫ u_(1) dx = μ_1,
	
	$ //[formula type:display]

such that the corresponding solution blows up in finite time.
More precisely,
let
$ψ$
be a smooth function supported in a compact set
and its integral is
$1$
.
Let
$L$
be a large positive number.
If
	$
	u_(0)(x)  &= ψ(x) + (μ_0-1) ψ(x-L), \
	u_(1)(x)  &= μ_1 ψ(x-L),
	$ //[formula type:align*]
then one can show
$u(t,x) = u_(b)(t,x) + u_(g)(t,x-L)$
till some time,
where
$u_(b)$
is the blow-up solution with initial data
$(u_(0), u_(1)) = (ψ,0)$
and
$u_(g)$
is the solution with initial data
$(u_(0), u_(1)) = ((μ_0-1)ψ, μ_1 ψ)$
.
Since the argument above implies that
$∫ u_(b) + ∂_t u_(b) dx$
blows up in finite time
and
$∫ u_(g) + ∂_t u_(g) dx$
is increasing,
there exists a time
$t_(0)$
such that
	$
	
	∫ u(t_(0)) + ∂_t u(t_(0)) dx
	= ∫ u_(b)(t_(0)) + ∂_t u_(b)(t_(0)) dx + ∫ u_(g)(t_(0)) + ∂_t u_(g)(t_(0)) dx
	> 0.
	
	$ //[formula type:display]

Therefore, the solution
$u$
blows up in finite time
by the same argument from
$t=t_(0)$
.

// %[[[ The aim of this manuscript
The aim of this manuscript
is to generalize a sufficient condition
for global existence of solutions to
@eq:DW //[ref type:eqref]
.
For simplicity, we restrict our attention to the one-dimensional case.
In particular,
we show that the blow-up conditions based on the spatial integrals of the initial data,
namely
@eq:initial_mean_condition //[ref type:eqref]
and
@eq:initial_mean_condition_ours //[ref type:eqref]
,
cannot be relaxed without taking into account the shape of the initial data,
provided that the spatial integral of the initial position is positive.
More precisely, we ask the following question:
Does there exist a constant
$c_(0) > 0$
such that, for
	$
	
	0 < ε_0 < c_(0) |ε_1| ≪ 1,
	
	$ //[formula type:display]

there exists a smooth, positive function
$φ$
such that
the solution with initial data
$(u_(0),u_(1)) = (ε_0 φ, ε_1 φ)$
exists globally in time?
To the best of the authors' knowledge,
global existence for
@eq:DW //[ref type:eqref]
has only been established via comparison arguments.
Accordingly, we employ the following simple sufficient condition for global existence:
there exist a constant
$c_(0) > 0$
and a smooth, positive function
$φ$
such that, for
	$
	
	ε_0 < c_(0) |ε_1| ≪ 1,
	
	$ //[formula type:display]

the solution
$u$
with initial data
$(u_(0),u_(1)) = (ε_0 φ, ε_1 φ)$
satisfies
	$
u(t,x) ≤ 0,\ \ ∂_t u(t,x) + (1)/(2)u(t,x) ≤ 0
	$ //[formula type:align]
for all
$x$
at some time
$t$
.
Once
@eq:aim //[ref type:eqref]
is verified,
Theorem 1.2 in
@FG25a //[ref type:cite]
yields global existence.
Decay in this case is studied in
@FG25b //[ref type:cite]
.

The following is the main statement of this manuscript,
answering the question above:
#theorem(id: "theorem:main")[
Let
	$ 0 < ε_0 < -ε_1 ≪ 1.
	\label{eq:condition_ratio} $ //[formula type:align]
Then there exists a sufficiently small number $ρ$ and
a positive function $φ ∈ W^{2,1} ∩ W^{2,∞}$

	$ \label{eq:shape_assumption} \tag{H1}
	|φ^'(x)| + |φ^{''} (x)| ≤ ρ  φ(x) , \ \ \forall x ≥ 0 $ //[formula type:align]

	$ t(ε_0/|ε_1|)+δ ∈ (0,2), $ //[formula type:display]
where $δ>0$ is sufficiently small
and $t=t(ε_0/|ε_1|)$ is the unique positive solution 
of 
	$ \label{eq.deft}
	(ε_0)/(|ε_1|) =  (4t)/((4-t)(2+t)). $ //[formula type:align]
] //[Theorem]
We give some remarks on Theorem
@theorem:main //[ref type:ref]
.
First,
the condition
@eq:condition_ratio //[ref type:eqref]
is optimal.
Indeed, for
$ε_0 + ε_1 ≥ 0$
,
we can apply Theorem 1.1 in
@FG25a //[ref type:cite]
and deduce blow-up.
Second,
for any positive
$ρ$
,
there exists a function
$φ ∈ W^(2,1) ∩ W^(2,∞)$
satisfying
@eq:shape_assumption //[ref type:eqref]
.
Indeed, let
$N$
be an integer,
$a >1$
, and
	$
	
	φ(x) = (N^(2)+x^(2))^{-a/2}
	
	$ //[formula type:display]

then
$φ ∈ W^(2,1) ∩ W^(2,∞)$
and
	$
	|φ^'(x)|  &= ≤ (a)/(N) φ(x),\
	|φ^{''}(x)|  &= ≤ (a(a+1))/(N^(2)) φ(x),
	$ //[formula type:align*]
so
$ρ = a/N + a(a+1)/N^(2) \to 0$
as
$N \to ∞.$
Third,
the condition
@eq:shape_assumption //[ref type:eqref]
plays an important role
in obtaining the pointwise estimate
@eq:aim //[ref type:eqref]
.
In particular,
@eq:shape_assumption //[ref type:eqref]
implies that
solutions
$u$
are estimated by
$φ$
pointwisely up to a certain time,
and this pointwise control implies the conclusion.
Finally,
the function
	$
	
	a(t) = (4t)/((4-t)(2+t))
	
	$ //[formula type:display]

is strictly increasing for
$t ∈ (0,2)$
, with
$a(0)=0$
and
$a(2)=1$
.
Therefore, the unique positive solution
$t ∈ (0,2)$
of
@eq.deft //[ref type:eqref]
is well-defined.
The smallness of
$δ$
is determined by
	$
	
	δ < b(t)-a(t),
	
	$ //[formula type:display]

where
	$
	
	b(t) = (8t)/((2+t)^2).
	
	$ //[formula type:display]

The proof that
$b(t)>a(t)$
for
$t ∈ (0,2)$
is elementary
and can be found at the end of the proof of Theorem
@theorem:main //[ref type:ref]
.

We note that
it is still unclear whether
there exists a global solution to
@eq:DW //[ref type:eqref]
in the case where
$(u_(0),u_(1)) = (ε_0 φ, ε_1 φ)$
with smooth positive
$φ$
and
$ε_0$
and
$ε_1$
are sufficiently small and satisfy
	$
	
	ε_0 < 0, 
	ε_1 > 0, 
	ε_0 + ε_1 < 0, 
	\mbox{and} \
	ε_1 + ε_0/2 > 0.

Let $ε_0$ and $ε_1$ are real constans sufficiently close to $0$
satisfying $0 < ε_0 < - ε_1$.
Let $t ∈ (0,T_0)$ and $ρ >0$ satisfy
	$ C ( |ε_1|^{p-1} + ρ ) t < 1

Assume that $φ ∈ W^{2,1} ∩ W^{2,∞}$

Then $u$ enjoys the following estimate for $t ∈ (0,T_0)$:

#proof[
We make the substitution
	$ v(t,x) = (u(t,x))/(φ(x)), $ //[formula type:display]
so we have

	+ 2 (\dot φ ∂_x u)/(φ^2)
	+ (\ddot φ)/(φ^2) u
	- 2 (\dot φ^2)/(φ^3) u $ //[formula type:align*]
Since
	$ ∂_x u = v \dot φ  + φ ∂_x v $ //[formula type:display]
we arrive at

We use the following identity, obtained in @DA98 //[ref type:cite]
(see Lemma 2.1 in @DA98 //[ref type:cite])
	$ ( φ(α) + φ(β))/(2) - (1)/(β - α) ∫_{α}^{β} φ(σ) d σ

Assuming @eq.bb1 //[ref type:eqref], we get
@eq.HH1 //[ref type:eqref].

It is easy to extend this estimate also to the cases $α < 0 < β$ and $α < β <0$
using the additional assumption that $φ$ is an even function.
In fact, when $α < 0 < β$ we define the interval $J\subset [0,∞)$ with ends $-α$ and $β$ and then we can apply @eq.HH1 //[ref type:eqref] so we have

	r_2(t)
	&= \frac{1-e^{-τ}}{C ( |ε_1|^{p-1} + ρ ) τ}. $ //[formula type:align*]
] //[Lemma]
#proof[
We split the proof into three cases,
$r < r_1(t)$, $r ∈ [r_1(t), r_2(t)]$ and $r > r_2(t)$.

We note that $r_1$ is a increasing function and $r_2$ is a decreasing function.
The monotonicity of $r_2$ follows from the fact that
	$ \frac{1-e^{-τ}}{τ}
	= ∫_0^1 e^{-τ σ} d σ. $ //[formula type:display]
Therfore, $r ∈ [r_1(t), r_2(t)]$ implies that
	$ r ∈ \bigcap_{τ ∈ [0,t]} [r_1(τ), r_2(τ)]. $ //[formula type:display]
Since $C δ t < 1$, we note that $1-e^{-τ} ∈ [r_1(τ), r_2(τ)]$ for any $τ ∈ [0,t]$.
In the case where $r ∈ [r_1(τ), 1-e^{-τ}]$, we have
	$ &G(τ,r,ρ, ε_1) ≤ r\\
	\Leftrightarrow & \frac{ 1 - e^{-τ} - r}{1-C ( |ε_1|^{p-1} + ρ ) τ} ≤ r\\
	\Leftrightarrow & 1 - e^{-τ} - r ≤ r (1-C ( |ε_1|^{p-1} + ρ ) τ)\\
	\Leftrightarrow & r ≥ \frac{1-e^{-τ}}{2-C ( |ε_1|^{p-1} + ρ ) τ} = r_1(τ). $ //[formula type:align*]
Similarly, in the case where $r ∈ [1-e^{-τ}, r_2(τ)]$, we have
	$ &G(τ,r,ρ, ε_1) ≤ r\\
	\Leftrightarrow & \frac{ r - 1 + e^{-τ}}{1-C ( |ε_1|^{p-1} + ρ ) τ} ≤ r\\
	\Leftrightarrow & r - 1 + e^{-τ} ≤ r (1-C ( |ε_1|^{p-1} + ρ ) τ)\\
	\Leftrightarrow & r ≤ \frac{1-e^{-τ}}{C ( |ε_1|^{p-1} + ρ ) τ} = r_2(τ). $ //[formula type:align*]
These computations imples that $C(t,r,ρ, ε_1) = r$ for $r ∈ [r_1(t), r_2(t)]$.

In the case where $r < r_1(t)$,
$C(t,r,ρ, ε_1) = G(t,r,ρ, ε_1)$ because $C(\cdot,r,ρ, ε_1)$ is increasing.

In the case where $r > r_2(t)$,
we compute
	$ ∂_τ G(τ,r,ρ, ε_1)
	&= - \frac{ e^{-τ}}{1-C ( |ε_1|^{p-1} + ρ ) τ}
	+ \frac{ C ( |ε_1|^{p-1} + ρ ) (r + e^{-τ} - 1) }{(1-C ( |ε_1|^{p-1} + ρ ) τ)^2}\\
	&= \frac{ C ( |ε_1|^{p-1} + ρ ) (r + ( τ + 1 ) e^{-τ} - 1) - e^{-τ} }{(1-C ( |ε_1|^{p-1} + ρ ) τ)^2}\\
	&= e^{-τ} \frac{ C ( |ε_1|^{p-1} + ρ ) ( τ + 1) - 1 - (1-r) C ( |ε_1|^{p-1} + ρ ) e^τ }{(1-C ( |ε_1|^{p-1} + ρ ) τ)^2}. $ //[formula type:align*]
So $∂_τ G(0,r,ρ, ε_1) < 0$.
Moreover, we also compute
	$ &∂_τ \{ C ( |ε_1|^{p-1} + ρ ) ( τ + 1) - 1 - (1-r) C ( |ε_1|^{p-1} + ρ ) e^τ \}\\
	&= C ( |ε_1|^{p-1} + ρ ) (1 - (1-r) e^τ). $ //[formula type:align*]

	$ C(t,r,ρ, ε_1) = G(min(t,- log(1-r)),r,ρ, ε_1). $ //[formula type:display]

$r ∈ (0,1)$
and there exists
$t$
such that 
}

the following two inequalities hold:
	\begin{equation}\label{sys1}
	\begin{cases}
	(1)/(8)  ( //[command type:left]
	(t(1-r/2)-r )/((1-t^2/4))  ) //[command type:right]

	< ( //[command type:bigg]
	1 - (r)/(2)  ) //[command type:bigg]
 ( //[command type:bigg]
	(1)/(2t) ) //[command type:bigg]
,\\
	(1)/(8) t  ( //[command type:left]
	(t(1-r/2)-r )/((1-t^2/4))  ) //[command type:right]

	< 1 - ( //[command type:bigg]
	(1)/(2) + (1)/(2t)) //[command type:bigg]
 r,\\
	r
	< (4t)/((4-t)(2+t))
	
and
	\begin{equation}\label{sys2}
	\begin{cases}
	(1)/(8)  r
	< ( //[command type:bigg]
	1 - (r)/(2)  ) //[command type:bigg]
 ( //[command type:bigg]
	(1)/(2t) ) //[command type:bigg]
,\\
	(1)/(8) t  r
	< \frac 1 2 - ( //[command type:bigg]
	(1)/(4) + (1)/(2t)) //[command type:bigg]
 r,\\
	r > (4t)/((4-t)(2+t)).
	
In particular, if
$r ∈ [0,1)$
admits some
$t ∈ (0,2)$
such that
$(t,r)$
satisfies either
@sys1 //[ref type:eqref]
or
@sys2 //[ref type:eqref]
,
then one can choose
$c_(0)$
sufficiently close to
$1/4$
and
$ρ>0$
sufficiently small
so that the assumptions
@eq:condition_for_u_devided //[ref type:eqref]
,
@eq.a1 //[ref type:eqref]
and
@eq.a2 //[ref type:eqref]
in Lemmas
@lemma:condition_for_negative_speed //[ref type:ref]
and
@lemma:condition_for_negative_position //[ref type:ref]
are satisfied.
Consequently,
$\mathcal B$
contains the following set:
	$
	
	\mathcal C
	= \{r ∈ [0,1); \exists t, \ (t,r) \ \mbox{is a solution to \eqref{sys2}}\}.
	
	$ //[formula type:display]

Finally, we show that
$\mathcal C \supset [0,1)$
.
The system
@sys2 //[ref type:eqref]
is equivalent to
	$
cases(
	r <   (4)/(2+t)\,\
	r < (8t)/((2+t)^2)\,\
	r > (4t)/((4-t)(2+t)).
	)
	$ //[formula type:align]
A positive solution
$r$
can be found iff
	$
	
	(4t)/((4-t)(2+t)) < min ( //[command type:left]
	(4)/(2+t), (8t)/((2+t)^2)  ) //[command type:right]
 .
	
	$ //[formula type:display]

Note that for
$t ∈ [0,4)$
	$
	
	(4t)/((4-t)(2+t)) < (4)/(2+t)
	
	$ //[formula type:display]

is equivalent to
$t <2$
and
	$
	
	(4t)/((4-t)(2+t)) < (8t)/((2+t)^2)
	
	$ //[formula type:display]

is equivalent to
$t <2.$
Therefore the interval
	$
	I(t)  &= (a(t),b(t)), \
	a(t)  &= (4t)/((4-t)(2+t)) , \
	b(t)  &= min ( //[command type:left]
	(4)/(2+t), (8t)/((2+t)^2)  ) //[command type:right]
	$ //[formula type:align*]
is nonempty for any
$t ∈ (0,2).$
Note that
	$
	
	(8t)/((2+t)^2) < (4)/(2+t)
	
	$ //[formula type:display]

for
$t ∈ (0,2).$
Therefore,
	$
	
	b(t) = (8t)/((2+t)^2).
	
	$ //[formula type:display]

The function
$a$
is increasing on
$[0,4)$
, because
	$
	
	a(t)
	= (4)/(4-t)( //[command type:bigg]
	1 - (2)/(t+2) ) //[command type:bigg]
.
	
	$ //[formula type:display]

Moreover,
$a(0)=0 $
and
$ a(2)=b(2)=1$
imply that
	$
	
	\mathcal{A} \supset \mathcal{B} \supset \mathcal{C} \supset [0,1).
	
	$ //[formula type:display]

This completes the proof.
